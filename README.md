# Set-OS-Date-Time-Using-Python

## Description
- A Simple Python Script I Wrote To Set Both Date & Time On Windows/Linux OS With Python Installed, 

- For Those With Battery Issues Having To Set Date & Time Whenever OS System Boots.

- When Run If No Internet Connection, It Sleeps For 1 Minute Before Trying To Retrieve Date & Time.

- When Date & Time Is Set Successfully The Program Exits.
